# mlensemble

Ensembles of machine learning models


## Synopsis

Package `mlensemble` provides a framework for managing ensembles of machine
learning models. Importantly, the framework does not train or evaluate
individual models. It only provides an interface for putting existing models
together into ensembles. The framework is agnostic to the implementation details
of individual models. This approach allows ensembles to have heterogeneous
components such as models trained, for example, on different training datasets
or with different feature sets. At the same time, the framework allows for
ensemble calibration. This offers opportunities to tune how individual models
come together to form integrated predictions.


## Installation

The package can be installed through github. 

```{r installation, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(devtools)
install_github("tkonopka/mlenesemble")
```

## Minimal example

Consider a dataset with three variables `x1`, `x2`, and `y`, which are all
dependent on a hidden variable `x`.

```{r}
x <- seq(0, 10, length=21)
d <- data.frame(
  x1 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  x2 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  y = x + rnorm(length(x))
)
```
Consider the task of predicting `y` given `x1` and `x2`.

With the `mlensemble` package, this problem can be addressed by first training
models using base R, and then combining them into an ensemble.

```{r}
# train models using base R
lm_x1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data=d)
lm_x2 <- lm(y ~ x2, data=d)
# create an ensemble of two models
library(mlensemble)
ensemble <- ml_model(lm_x1) + ml_model(lm_x2)
```

The ensemble can be used to predict `y` on new data.

```{r, warning=TRUE}
test_d <- data.frame(x1 = c(1, 2), x2 = c(1, 2))
predict(ensemble, test_d)
```

By default, predictions from individual models are pooled together by averaging.
However, the package offers a means to calibrate the ensemble and thus pool
predictions in a more principled manner. The package also supports attaching
custom functions to pre-process input data or post-process outputs. See the
package vignette for details.

The package also provides summaries in plain-language.

```{r}
summary(ensemble)
```
