# mlensemble

Ensembles of machine learning models


## Synopsis

Package `mlensemble` provides a framework for managing ensembles of machine learning models. Importantly, the framework does not train or evaluate individual models. It only provides an interface for putting existing models together into ensembles.

The framework is agnostic to the implementation details of individual models. This approach allows ensembles to have heterogeneous components, e.g. models trained on different training datasets or with different feature sets. At the same time, the framework allows for ensemble calibration. Calibration tunes how individual models come together to form integrated predictions. This offers a means to adjust ensembles to properties of new datasets without the need to retrain the underlying models.


## Installation

The package can be installed through github. 

```{r installation, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(devtools)
install_github("tkonopka/mlenesemble")
```

## Minimal example

Consider a training dataset with three variables `x1`, `x2`, and `y`, which are
dependent on a hidden variable `x`.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
x <- seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
data_train <- data.frame(
  x1 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  x2 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  y = x + rnorm(length(x))
)
```
Consider the task of predicting `y` given `x1` and `x2`. With `mlensemble`,
this problem can be addressed by training models using base R, and then
combining them into an ensemble.

```{r}
lm_x1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data=data_train)
lm_x2 <- lm(y ~ x2, data=data_train)
library(mlensemble)
ensemble <- ml_model(lm_x1) + ml_model(lm_x2)
# prediction on test data (emits a warning)
data_test <- data.frame(x1 = c(1, 10), x2 = c(1, 10))
predict(ensemble, data_test)
```

By default, the ensemble pools predictions from individual models by averaging
and using equal weights for all models. However, the package can calibrate
ensembles and combine predictions in a more principled manner. This is
especially interesting when new data are expected to have slightly different
properties than the training data.

```{r, warning=TRUE}
# calibration using data with noise in x2
x_calib <- seq(1, 10)
data_calib <- data.frame(
  x1 = x_calib + rnorm(length(x_calib)),
  x2 = x_calib + rnorm(length(x_calib), 200, 10),
  y = x_calib + rnorm(length(x_calib))
)
ensemble_calibrated <- calibrate(ensemble, data_calib, data_calib$y)
# new data with noise in x2
data_noisy <- data.frame(x1=c(1, 10), x2=c(300, 300))
# predictions by the uncalibrated ensemble are affected by extreme values of x2
predict(ensemble, data_noisy)
# predictions by the calibrated ensemble are less affected by x2
predict(ensemble_calibrated, data_noisy)
````

The package provides summaries in plain language.

```{r}
summary(ensemble_calibrated)
```

As the summary suggests, the package supports attaching custom functions to pre-process input data or post-process outputs. See the package vignette for details.


## Features

The package provides the following features and capabilities:

  - creation of ensembles via composition of heterogeneous models using the `+` operator
  - support for regression and multi-class classification; classification models must provide output in the form of probabilities for each class
  - support for custom predictors implemented as an R function
  - support for heterogeneous models, including models using different sets of input features
  - tested with models created by `lm`, `glm`, and `xgboost` (library [xgboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html))
  - should, in principle, be compatible with any R model that supports the `predict` method
  - harmonization of class labels in the context of multi-class classification (e.g. when integrating models using different sets of labels)
  - attaching custom pre-processing and post-processing functions
  - calibration of ensembles using calibration datasets
  - plain-language descriptions of individual models and model ensembles

It is important to note that the package does not train new models. It also does not compare the performance of competing models on training or test datasets. For these tasks, see other machine-learning frameworks in R, for example [caret](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/) or [mlr3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr3/index.html).
