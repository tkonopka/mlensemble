## Model and ensemble descriptions

The `summary` method generates plain-language descriptions for `ml_model` and `ml_ensemble` objects. A core description for a model consists of one paragraph, for example,

```{r}
summary(m_lm_x1)
```
The description can be tuned via the `description` argument in the constructor (see `help(ml_model)` for details). As an example,

```{r}
m_custom <- ml_model(lm_x1, name="custom", description="is a linear regression")
summary(m_custom)
```

Descriptions are also available for ensembles. Paragraphs describe the overall purpose of the ensemble, the constituent models, calibration status, and any pre-processing and post-processing hooks.

```{r}
summary(e_with_hooks_calib)
```
