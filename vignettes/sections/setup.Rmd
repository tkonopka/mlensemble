## Setup

The vignette relies on package `mlensemble`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(mlensemble)
```

Examples refer to a regression task based on a small synthetic dataset.
Consider a variable `x` with linear relationships to variables `x1`, `x2`, and
`y`. Consider that `x` is not observable, and that training data consist of
noisy measurements of the other quantities.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
x <- seq(0, 10, length=21)
d <- data.frame(
  x1 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  x2 = x + rnorm(length(x)),
  y = x + rnorm(length(x))
)
head(d, 4)
```

The regression task is to predict `y`. Both `x1` and `x2` are correlated with
`y` and can be used individually to predict `y`. They can also be used
together. The optimal strategy will depend on the distributions of the data in
the training dataset as well as the expected properties in future measurements.
