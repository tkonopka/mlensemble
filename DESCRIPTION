Description: Ensembles of heterogeneous machine learning models can provide more robust predictions than individual models. The package provides a framework to create ensembles via composition of already-trained models, to attach custom pre-processing and post-processing functions to each model and to ensembles, and to calibrate ensembles. The framework supports regression and multi-class classification.
